# Work Process

1) After creating a responsive navbar I used react router to create different routes.
2) Then I used loader & useLoaderData function to dynamically pass to value from the API to components.
3) After destructuring the loadedData ,I used map function on objects & arrays and created different useful sections for the site.
4) I used eventHandlers to get the input from user and used if else method to check the answers and show to UI by a toast.
5) I created a chart on statistics route by using rechart js.
6) Last but not least I made the whole site responsive and deployed the project in netlify.
